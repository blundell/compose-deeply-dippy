# Deeply Dippy Library

Example
```
16.dip
```

YES! You too can now feel the nostalgia of those dip's, straight in compose, no more making excuses to use XML just to see another `dip`!

This is a wrapper on `androidx.compose.ui.unit.Dp.kt` if you see anything missing file a Pull Request to fix it, if you fail too fix it yourself & still have some energy file an issue. :-)
